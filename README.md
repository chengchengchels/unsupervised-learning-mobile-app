# mobile app landscape in the US: An App and its target market with unsupervised learning in Python

## Summary

The dataset is generated from the recently-conducted ‘Mobile App Research Survey’, which contains 57 questions, including demographic (q1-q13) and behavioral (q48-57) information of 1552 respondents. There are millions of mobile apps. I’m going to analyze app download behavior as well as other information related to consumers. users can be segmented based on unsupervised machine learning techniques, suggestions can be made on a significant actionable market need in which an app can be developed to fulfill, and one significant market segment to target with the new app.  
Exploratory data analysis is conducted for the general outlook of the US mobile app landscape, with young female being the main population, most people own around 30 apps, around half of the apps were not free, and college students take the lead. Married and single population are 50/50, major responds are white or Caucasian; there are few slightly wealthier people.

### Market Need:

Based on the factor loading results, a new app can be suggested to display well-sorted trending high-quality information covering only the limited popular topics in technology and entertainment, in a clean and simple manner to tailor the needs of while making things easier for the majority.
  

(this analysis is not complete, more work remains to be done in respect of market targeting strategy.)
